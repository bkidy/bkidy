* 🚀 At Mew.Design, we're **dedicated to revolutionizing the creative collaboration experience by building next-generation human-like AI designers, enabling AI to replace real designers and fulfill client requirements.**
* 💻 I firmly believe that the best products (and tech) stem from a deep understanding of user needs and hands-on technical implementation. You'll often find me deep in code, primarily with JavaScript/TypeScript, and exploring new AI-driven development techniques.
* 💡 I enjoy transforming abstract ideas into tangible, working software and cherish the creative process from 0 to 1, and then from 1 to N, especially with the accelerating power of AI.
* 🛠️ While I have a background in Product Management, I'm increasingly focused on hands-on development in this AI era. I actively code with **[JavaScript/TypeScript (React, Node.js, Wasp), Tailwind CSS, Python for AI/scripting, Cloud Architecture (AWS)]**, and extensively leverage AI tools like **Cursor** and **Claude** for an intuitive 'vibe coding' experience and accelerated development cycles.
🌱 I'm always learning and exploring, aiming to create impactful solutions by blending product thinking with cutting-edge technology.
